1. Build the NAND Gate Circuit

The NAND gate in this circut is taking in 2 inputs and is determining the output based on those inputs. When one switch is off and the other is on, the LED is on.
If both of the switches are off, then the LED is on. This gate is using boolean logic to determine the outcome. 

2. Build Another Circuit of Your Choice

This is a circut including a NOR logic gate. The NOR logic gate decides when the LED turns on based on the power input it recieves. If both of the switches are off, the 
LED turns on. All other cases result in the LED turned off. 

3. Utilize the Universal Logic Gates

This circut uses 2 NOR gates to make an OR gate. This means that the LED is always on except for when the 2 switches have a value of 0, meaning that they are turned off.
